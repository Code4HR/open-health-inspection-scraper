Open Health Inspections Scraper
==============================

This is a tool to get Virginia restaurant health inspection data from the <a href="http://healthspace.com/Clients/VDH/VDH/web.nsf/home.xsp">HealthSpace</a> website into a database. This is a complete rebuild of v1.0 of the scraper to account for changes in the HealthSpace website and to take advantage of new libraries.

Technical
=========
The scraper is built for Python 3.4. It makes use of the <a href="http://scrapy.org/">Scrapy</a> library. Addresses will be geocoded using the <a href="http://smartystreets.com/">SmartyStreets</a> API. To use SmartyStreets you will need to obtain a key.


To run:

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.

2. Set the following environment variables or use the defaults in `scraper/settings.py`:
```
MONGODB_SERVER
MONGODB_PORT
MONGODB_DB
MONGODB_COLLECTION
```

   If you want to use the SmartyStreets geocoding integration, also set the following environment variables:
	 ```
	 SS_ID
	 SS_TOKEN
	 ```
3. Run the python 3.x script. The scraper can be stopped using `Ctrl/Cmd + C` (only once) and can then be restarted at the point where it stopped. It will save it's progress in the folder specified by the `JOBDIR` setting in `scraper/settings.py`
